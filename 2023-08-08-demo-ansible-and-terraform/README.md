# Ansible vs./and Terraform

The folder contains two demos.  
The first one provisions VMs in AWS with Terraform and configures these with Ansible, this demo was written by Susan and My.  
The second one provisions (systemd-enabled) Docker containers locally with Terraform and configures these with Ansible, this demo was written by Tim.
